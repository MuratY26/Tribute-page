          Albert Einstein was one of the worlds greatest thinkers. His academic
          works in physics caused his name to be a synonym for genius. He is
          best known for developing the theory of relativity. He also made
          important contributions to quantum theory. One of his famous quotes:
          "God does not play dice with the universe" is frequently taken as an
          argument against probabilities in quantum physics. However Einstein
          did not denied the probability, he thought that there are things we
          can not comprehend under the things that seem us as randomness.

          The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the
          fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true
          science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer
          marvel, is as good as dead and his eyes are dimmed.
